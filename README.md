# 🧪 EIS/gIIS Analysis Simulation
This repository contains an interactive Python code designed to simulate and display the behavior of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Generalized Ionic Impedance Spectroscopy (gIIS) experiments for different Mixed ionic-electronic conductor material devices and configurations. Options are presented via images, and each type of system requires custom parameters for execution.
